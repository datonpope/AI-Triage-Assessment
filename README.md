# AI-Triage-Assessment
This project showcases the use of OpenAI's GPT-3 model for medical triage assessment. Given patient information such as age, symptoms, and medical history, the AI provides a triage decision and explanation. The project demonstrates prompt engineering, API integration, and evaluation of AI-generated responses.
